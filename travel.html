  <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today 
    <blockquote>:"Passing cars, when you can't see, May get you, A glimpose, Of eternity."
    <blockquote>
  <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars

  My frist day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everthing
  packed and readly and ready to go. Because I can't I'm on a Segway, I wasn't 
  able to able to bring a whole a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
  digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essention. As Lao Tzu would have said ,"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway"
